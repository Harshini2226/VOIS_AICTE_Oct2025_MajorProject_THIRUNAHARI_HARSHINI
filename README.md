Major Project: Netflix Dataset Analysis
1. Introduction to Dataset
The dataset under consideration is a Netflix dataset containing 7,789 records and 11 
columns. It includes important details about Movies and TV Shows available on the 
platform. Key attributes include the title, director, cast, country of origin, release date, 
rating, duration, and type (genres). The dataset spans multiple years, with entries 
ranging from 2008 to 2021, covering content across diverse countries and genres.
2. Problem Statement
Netflix has become one of the most prominent global streaming platforms, continuously 
expanding its library with a mix of original productions and licensed content. However, 
with growing competition from platforms like Amazon Prime, Disney+, and regional OTT 
providers, Netflix must strategically analyze its content catalog to identify strengths, 
gaps, and opportunities. 
The specific problem to be addressed in this project is 'Content Trends Analysis for 
Strategic Recommendations'. The aim is to uncover how Netflix’s content distribution 
(Movies vs. TV Shows, genres, and country contributions) has evolved over the years. 
This will enable the identification of key genres, audience preferences, and strategic 
insights into global content expansion.
3. Importance of the Problem Statement
Understanding Netflix’s content trends is crucial for making data-driven business 
decisions. The analysis not only highlights the balance between Movies and TV Shows 
but also reveals popular genres and underrepresented categories. For a platform that 
serves diverse international audiences, country-wise contributions provide valuable 
insights into global representation and market penetration. 
By focusing on these content trends, Netflix can refine its strategy for content acquisition 
and production, ensuring that it caters to the right audience segments while staying 
competitive in the global OTT industry.
4. Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows over the years.
- Identify the most common genres and how their popularity has changed.
- Compare country-wise contributions to Netflix’s catalog.
5. Expected Outcomes
- A clear understanding of how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved.
- Identification of top-performing genres and categories.
- Strategic recommendations on which content types Netflix should focus on in the 
future.
